Termbin4PS version 1.1.1, relesaed 2021-01-14
---------------------------------------------
Error handling is improved, and a Pester tests for the module is now available.
However, Out-Termbin is unmodified. 

Termbin4PS version 1.1, released 2020-11-22
---------------------------------------------
I realized that Out would be a better verb than Send.  Thus, I've renamed the
command to Out-Termbin.  Send-Termbin is now an alias, so you do not need to
rewrite any of your own scripts.

Termbin4PS version 1.0.1, released 2020-10-29
---------------------------------------------
You can now view help online by running:  Get-Help Send-Termbin -Online.
That is the only change.

Termbin4PS version 1.0, released 2020-09-30
-------------------------------------------
